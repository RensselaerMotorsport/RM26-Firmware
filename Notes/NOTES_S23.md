* BMS:
  - Can broadcast cell level voltage at a given delay/rate
  - I don't think it's possible to send the average cell voltage
  - Need figure out temperature transmission still, haven't found broadcasting information.

* IMD:
  - I would like to get the SIM101.dbc file from Sendyne to make hopefully setup the CAN profiles automatically and not have to figure out the addressing of data individually (documentation is a bit painful to read).
  - Sendyne is currently not responding (haven't even been able to buy it yet, need to buy soon).
